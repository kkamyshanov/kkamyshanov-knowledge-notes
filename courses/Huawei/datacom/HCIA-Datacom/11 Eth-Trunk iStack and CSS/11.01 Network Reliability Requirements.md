-- It refers to the capability of the ensuring nonstop network services when a single point or multiple points of failure occur on a device or link
-- It can be implemented at the card, device, and link levels

Card Reliability
-- A modular switch consists of a chassis, power modules, fan modules, main processing units (MPUs), switch fabric units (SFUs), and line processing units (LPUs)
-- Chassis provides slots for various cards and modules to implement inter-card communication
-- Power module: power supply system of the device
-- Fan module: heat dissipation system
-- MPU: responsible for the control plane and management plane of the entire system
-- SFU: responsible for the data plane of the entire system. The data plane provides high-speed non-blocking data channels for data switching between service modules
-- LPU: provides data forwarding functions on a physical device and provides optical and electrical interfaces of different rates
