11.2.1 Principle of Link Aggregation
Increasing Link Bandwidth
Multiple links between devices, traffic is forwarded on only one link due to STP. In this case, the inter-device link bandwidth remains unchanged
Eth-Trunk Ethernet Link Aggregation
Bundles multiple physical links into a logical link to increase link bandwidth, without having to upgrade hardware
-- Link Aggregation Group, LAG
-- Member interface and member link
-- Active interface and active link
-- Inactive interface and inactive link
-- Link aggregation mode: manual mode and LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) mode
-- Other concepts: upper and lower threshold for the number of active interfaces


11.2.2 Manual Mode
-- Eth-Trunk manually created and its member interfaces are manually configured. LACP is not used for negotiation between the two systems
-- In most cases, all links are active links. In this mode, all active links forward data and evenly share traffic. If an active link is faulty, the LAG automatically evenly shares traffic among the remaining active links
-- If one of the devices at both ends of an LAG does not support LACP, you can use manual mode
Defects:
-- Only one switch to second switch (not multiple)
-- Requirement: The peer interfaces reside on the same device
-- Requirement: The peer interfaces are added to the same Eth-Trunk
-- In manual mode, devices do not exchange packets. Therefore, the configuration needs to be manually confirmed
-- Device can determine whether the peer interface is working properly based only on the physical layer status


11.2.3 LACP Mode
-- A link aggregation mode that uses the LACP protocol. Devices exchange Link Aggregation Control Protocol Data Units (LACPDUs) to ensure that the peer interfaces are member interfaces that belong to the same Eth-Trunk and are on the same device
-- An LACPDU contains the device priority, MAC address, interface priority, and interface number
++++++++ System Priority
-- In LACP mode, the number of active interfaces selected by devices at both ends must be consistent; otherwise, the Eth-Trunk cannot be set up. In this case, configure one end as the Actor. Then the other end selects active interfaces according to the Actor
-- The Actor is determined based on the LACP system priority. A smaller value indicates a higher priority
-- Default value is 32768
-- A smaller value indicates a higher priority
-- If priority equal, LACP will select a smaller MAC address (smaller -> higher priority)
++++++++ Interface Priority
-- After the Actor is selected,  both devices select active interfaces based on the interface priorities of the Actor. A smaller LACP interface priority value indicates a higher priority
-- Default value is 32768
-- A smaller value indicates a higher priority
-- If priority equal, LACP will select a smaller port number (smaller -> higher priority)
++++++++ Maximum Number of Active Interfaces
-- Can be configured (number of worked interfaces)
-- If one of worked interface will shut down, it will change to another based on number of backup interfaces (choose smaller priority or the smallest number (if priority the same))
Active Interfaces == 2 (U - up, F - fault, B - backup)
{U} -> {U}
{U} -> {F}
{B} -> {U}
++++++++ Load Balancing
-- Per-packet load balancing
-- Per-flow load balancing (recommend use this)
++++++++ Load Balancing Mode
-- Can based on IP addresses or MAC addresses
-- Can based on: Source IP address, Source MAC address, Destination IP address, Destination MAC address, Source and Destination IP addresses, Source and Destination MAC addresses
-- Proper load balancing algorithm (Source and Destination IP address mode)
-- Improper load balancing algorithm  (Source and Destination MAC address mode)


11.2.4 Typical Application Scenarios
-- Between switches
-- Between switch and server
-- Between a switch and stack
-- Heartbeat link of firewalls on host standby mode


11.2.5 Configuration Example
-- Create an Eth-Trunk
{} interface eth-trunk <trunk-id>
-- Configure a link aggregation mode
{Eth-Trunk1} mode { lacp | manual load-balance} (both ends must be same)
-- Add an interface to the Eth-Trunk
{GE0/0/1} eth-trunk <trunk-id>
-- Add an interface to the Eth-Trunk
{Eth-Trunk1} trunkport <interface-type> { interface number }
-- Enable interfaces at different rates to join the same Eth-Trunk interface
{Eth-Trunk1} mixed-rate link enable
Different rates are not allowed to join the same Eth-Trunk, and only interfaces at the same rate can be added to the same Eth-Trunk
-- Configure the LACP system priority
{} lacp priority <priority> (default 32768)
-- Configure the LACP interface priority
{GE0/0/1} lacp priority <priority> (default 32768)
-- Configure the maximum number of active interfaces
{Eth-Trunk1} max active-linknumber <number>
Maximum number can configure only in LACP mode
-- Configure the minimum number of active interfaces
{Eth-Trunk1} least active-linknumber <number>
When the number of active links is smaller than the lower threshold, the Eth-Trunk interface goes down

-- Example for Configuring an Eth-Trunk in Manual Mode
SW1 (GE 0/1 and 0/2) <-> (GE 0/1 and 0/2) SW2
--------------------------- {SW1}
{} interface eth-trunk 1
{Eth-Trunk1} trunkport gigabitethernet 0/0/1 to 0/0/2
{Eth-Trunk1} port link-type trunk
{Eth-Trunk1} port trunk allow-pass vlan 10 20
--------------------------- {SW2}
{} interface eth-trunk 1
{Eth-Trunk1} trunkport gigabitethernet 0/0/1 to 0/0/2
{Eth-Trunk1} port link-type trunk
{Eth-Trunk1} port trunk allow-pass vlan 10 20

-- Example for Configuring an Eth-Trunk in LACP Mode
