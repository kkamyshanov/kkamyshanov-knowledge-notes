iStack - multiple iStack-capable switches are connected using stacking cables to form a logical switch that participates in data forwarding

CSS Cluster Switch System: Two CSS-capable switches are bundled into one logical switch
A CSS consists of only two switches. Generally, modular switches support CSS, and fixed switches support iStack

Application scenarios
-- Extending the port quantity
-- Extending the bandwidth and implementing redundancy backup

Recommended Architecture
-- Core layer
++++ Core switches set up a CSS and use Eth-Trunks to connect to uplink and downlink devices, building a highly reliable and loop-free network
-- Aggregation layer
++++ Aggregation switches set up an iStack and use Eth-Trunks to connect to uplink and downlink devices, building a highly reliable loop-free network
-- Access layer
++++ Access devices that are geographically close to each other (such as access switches in a building) are virtualized into one logical device using iStack. This adds interfaces are simplifies management
++++ An Eth-Trunk is used to connect to the aggregation layer. The logical network architecture is simple, and STP and VRRP are not required. This networking offers high reliability, high uplink bandwidth, and fast convergence
