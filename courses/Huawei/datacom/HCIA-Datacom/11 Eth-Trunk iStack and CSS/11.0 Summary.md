As services develop and the network scale expands, users have increasingly demanding requirements on network bandwidth and reliability
In this chapter, we will describe how to use Eth-Trunk, intelligent stack (iStack), and cluster switch system (CSS) technologies to improve network bandwidth and reliability
You should be able to answer the following questions:
-- What is link aggregation (or Eth-Trunk)?
-- How to do link aggregation negotiation in Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) mode?
-- What are the difference between per-packet load balancing and per-flow load balancing?
-- What are the advantages of iStack and CSS?

-- Link aggregation can be classified into static and LACP aggreagation based on the aggregation mode
-- LACP uses packet negotiation to implement backup for active links. When a link fails, the backup link is elected as the active link to forward packets
-- To ensure the sequence in which packets arrive, link aggregation uses per-flow load balancing
-- iStack and CSS simplify network management and network structure, and improve network reliability
