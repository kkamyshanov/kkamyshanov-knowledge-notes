1.1.1 Concept of Network Communication
communication - transfer info between objects
network communication - between terminal devices, through a computer network
-- Information Transfer Process
PC - personal computer
GTWR - gateway router
WWW - Internet
|PC| <-> |GTWR| <-> |WWW| <-> |GTWR| <-> |PC| 
Data payload - information of packet (after remove header and tail)
Packet - transmit data unit
Header - segment added before data payload
Tail - segment added after data payload
Encapsulation - add header and tail to packet
Decapsulation -  remove header and tail of packet to get payload
Gateway - protocol conversion, route selection, data exchange
Router - select a forwarding path for packets
Terminal device - end device, used as a sender or receiver of data

1.1.2 Concept of the Data Communication Network
Devices: routers, switches, firewalls, access controllers (ACs), access points (APs), PCs, network printers, and servers
++ Switches - closest to end user (terminal device) (L2 device)
|PC| <-> |SW| <-> |PC|
++ Routers - forward from one subnet to another (L3 device), base on destination address choose the best path to forward packet
|PC| <-> |SW| <-> |GTWR| <-> |SW| <-> |PC|
++ Firewalls - network security device, ensure secure communication between two networks. Monitors, restricts, and modifies data flows
|PC| <-> |SW| <-> |GTWR| <-> |FRWL| <-> |WWW|
|PC| <-> |SW| <-> |FRWL| <-> |WWW|
-------- isolating networks of different security levels
-------- implementing access control between networks
-------- implement user identity authentication
-------- implementing network address translation
-------- implementing other security functions
++ Wireless devices
FatAP - a lot of manage functions in the AP
FitAP - just connect, AC helps with functions
-------- Home example --------
|PC| <-> |SW| <-> |GTWR+WWW| <-> |FatAP| <-> |PC|
-------- Company/University  example --------
|PC| <-> |AC| <-> |GTWR+WWW| <-> |FitAPxX| <-> |PC|
