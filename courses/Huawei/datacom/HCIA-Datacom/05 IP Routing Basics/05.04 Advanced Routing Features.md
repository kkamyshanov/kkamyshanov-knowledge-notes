5.4.1 Equal-Cost Route, Floating Route
-- Route Recursion
If we donâ€™t know nexthop, we can add static route for this with destination of this nexthop and will add new one
ip route-static 30.1.2.0 24 20.1.1.3
ip route-static 20.1.1.0 24 10.0.0.2
-- Equal-Cost Route
Choose any NextHop in that case (we can use load balancing)
-- Floating Route
Adding Preference and Backup
ip route-static 30.1.2.0 24 10.1.1.3 (default pre 60)
ip route-static 30.1.2.0 24 20.1.1.3 preference 70

5.4.2 Route Summarization (Aggregation)
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) uses IP addresses and masks to identify networks and subnets. CIDR replaces the previous addressing architecture of network design (such as classes A, B, C addresses)
CIDR is based on variable length subnet mask (VLSM)
Main idea: summarize not 8,16,24,32 to this flow to minimise routing table
192.168.12.0/22 -> 192.168.8.0/21
192.168.10.0/23 -> 192.168.8.0/21
