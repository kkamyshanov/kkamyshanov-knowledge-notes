Routing is the basic element of data communication networks
This chapter introduces the basic concepts of routing, how routes to forward IP packets, common route attributes, and default route
And also describes advanced routing features including route recursion, floating routes, and equal-cost routes
You should be able to answer the following questions:
-- How does a route select the optimal route?
-- How to generate routing entries?
-- How to do static routing configuration? 
-- What dynamic routing protocols are commonly used?

-- This section presents the basic concepts of routers, how routes instruct routers to forward IP packets, common route attributes, and default routes (special static routes)
-- In addition, this section describes advanced routing features including route recursion, floating routes, and equal-cost routes, which are widely used on live networks
