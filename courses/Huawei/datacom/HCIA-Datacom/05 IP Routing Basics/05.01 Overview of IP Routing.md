5.1.1 Basic Concepts of Routing
Route means the Path (used Routing Table)
A route contains:
-- Destination: destination subnet
-- Mask: subnet together with a destination address
-- Outbound interface: interface for send
-- Next hop: next hop address
10.1.1.0/24 | GE0/0/0 | 1.1.1.2

5.1.2 Generation of Routing Entries
Type of Routes
-- Direct
Automatically generated by a device
When a router is last hop router, IP packets to be forwarded will match a direct route
If we loose physical status, route will delete
-- Static
-- Dynamic

5.1.3 Optimal Route Selection
display ip routing table
Fields IP Routing Table
-- Destination/Mask
Choose the Longest Match Rule (Longest Mask)
32 - the highest priorities 
-- Proto
which protocol we learned the route
-- Pre (preference)
0 - the highest preference for route
-- Cost
if we have same preference we will choose the lowest cost
-- NextHop
next-hop device (mac)
-- Interface
Route Preference
-- Default Values
++ Direct (0)
++ Static (60)
++ Dynamic 
++++ OSPF internal route (10)
++++ OSPF external route (150)

5.1.4 Route-based Forwarding
Longest Matching (Choose route base on mask (32 - the highest priorities))
