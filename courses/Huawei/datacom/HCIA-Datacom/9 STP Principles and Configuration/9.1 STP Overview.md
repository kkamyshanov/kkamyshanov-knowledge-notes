STP - spanning tree protocol
Redundancy and Loops. on a Layer 2 Switching Network
Issues
(1)-->SW1<->SW2<->SW3<--(1)
-- Broadcast Storm
Flooding L2 Packets (when SW doesnâ€™t know about D.MAC)
++++ Broadcast
++++ Unknown unicast
++++ Multicast frame
-- MAC Address Flapping
MAC table always rewritten if receive interface was changed

BPDU - bridge packet data unit
When STP is deployed on a network, switches exchange STP BPDUs and calculate a loop-free topology. Finally, one or more ports on the network are blocked to eliminate loops
STP continuously monitors network topology, when topology changes, STP can detect an automatically adjust the network topology (restores one port, and removes another)
STP can solve the Layer 2 loop problem and provide a solution for network redundancy

Layer 2 loop
-- Common root cause: Layer 2 redundancy is deployed on the network, or cables are incorrectly connected 
-- Specific protocols or mechanisms are required to implement Layer 2 loop prevention
-- The Layer 2 frame header does not contain any information to prevent data frames from being forwarded infinitely

Layer 3 loop
-- Common root cause: routing loop
-- Dynamic routing protocols have certain loop prevention capabilities
-- The TTL field in the IP packet header can be used to prevent infinite packet forwarding
