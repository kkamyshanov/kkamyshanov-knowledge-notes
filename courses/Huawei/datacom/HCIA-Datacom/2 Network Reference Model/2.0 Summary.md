In this chapter, network reference model is introduced to present the data transmission process in the network
You should be able to answer the following questions:
-- How the data is defined and transmitted in the network?
-- What are the five layers in the TCP/IP reference model?
-- What are the common standard protocols in each layer?
-- How the data is encapsulated and decapsulated?

-- Both the OSI reference model and the TCP/IP reference model adopt the layered design concept
++++ Clear division of functions and boundaries between layers facilities the development, design, and troubleshooting of each component
++++ The functions of each layer can be defined to impel industry standardization
++++ Interfaces can be provided to enable communication between hardware and software on various networks, improving compatibility
-- Data generation and transmission require collaboration between modules. Meanwhile, each module must fulfill its own responsibilities
