This chapter describes the concepts related of Ethernet protocols, MAC address types, and working process and mechanism of Layer 2 switches
You should be able to answer to following questions:
-- How does as Ethernet switch work?
-- What is the difference among a unicast Ethernet frame, a broadcast Ethernet frame and a multicast Ethernet frame?
-- How does a switch learn the MAC address table using self-learning?

-- Describes the basic information about the Ethernet protocol, Ethernet frame formats, MAC address, and working principles of Layer 2 switches
Specifically, after receiving  a frame, a switch learns the source MAC address of the frame and searches the destination MAC address of the frame in the MAC address table. If the destination MAC address exists in the table, the switch forwards the frame through the corresponding interface
-- Describes the whole process of data communication within the same network segment based on the working principles of switches
