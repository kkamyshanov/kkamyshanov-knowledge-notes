Compared with same static routing which requires manual configuration, dynamic routing protocols are widely used on live networks because of their high flexibility, high reliability, and easy scalability. The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol is a widely used dynamic routing protocol. This chapter describes the basic concepts, working mechanism, and basic configurations of OSPF
You should be able to answer the following questions:
-- What are the advantages and classification of dynamic routing protocols?
-- What are the usage scenarios of OSPF?
-- How does OSPF work to generate optimal routing?
-- How to implement basic OSPF configurations?

-- OSPF is a widely used routing protocol on the live network
Describes basic concepts, application scenarios, and basic configurations of OSPF
-- Router ID, area, OSPF neighbour table, LSDB table, and OSPF routing table are basic OSPF concepts. Describes the establishment of OSPF neighbour relationships and adjacencies, which helps you better understand the link-state routing protocol
-- OSPF has more interesting  details, such as LSA types, the SPF calculation process, and the OSPF special area
