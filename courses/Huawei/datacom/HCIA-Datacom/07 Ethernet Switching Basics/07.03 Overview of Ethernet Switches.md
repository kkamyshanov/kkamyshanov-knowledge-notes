7.3.1 MAC Address Learning on a Switch
Layers of Switches (based on Campus Network)
-- Internet
-- Egress Layer
-- Core Layer
-- Aggregation Layer
-- Access Layer (Layer 2 Ethernet Switch)

Layer 2 Ethernet Switch
Forwarding data only according to the MAC address in a Layer 2 header
-(Packet)-> Learn S.MAC, and send to D.MAC ->
if Switch doesn't have D.MAC in table, it will flooding this packet (broadcast)

MAC Learn Table
Switch saves all MAC on interface
Example of table -> | MAC Address | Interface |
| MAC1 | GE0/0/0 |
| MAC2 | GE0/0/0 |
| MAC3 | GE0/0/1 |


7.3.2 Three Frame Processing Behaviors
-- Flooding (MAC-learn, first send)
-- Forwarding
-- Discarding
If Switch get D.MAC, and the same port as it has on table, it just drop it
D.MAC|GE0/0/0 -> Switch has D.MAC|GE0/0/0 in table -> drop the packet
Find D.MAC in table, if int == receive.int => drops the packet
