ACL Composition
Consists of several permit of deny statements. Each statement is a rule of ACL, and permit or deny in each statement is the action corresponding to the rule
-- Just for example, not real data
rule 5 permit source 1.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 -> rule 4294967294 deny (hidden at the end of the ACL)

Rule ID
Each rule in an ACL has an ID
Step
A step is an increment between neighboring rule IDs automatically allocated by the system 
Default step is 5
Setting a step facilities rule insertion between existing rules of an ACL

Rule ID allocation
If a rule is added to an empty ACL but no ID is manually specified for the rule, the system allocates a step value (5 for example) as the ID of the rule. If an ACL contains rules with manually specified IDs and rule with no manually specified ID is added, the system allocates to this rule an ID that is greater than the largest rule ID and is the smallest integer multiple of the step value

Wildcard
32-bit number (mask) to be strictly matched 0.0.0.255 (24)

ACL Classification and Identification
-- Based on ACL rule definition methods
++++ Basic ACL (2000 to 2999)
Source IPv4 addresses, fragmentation info, effective time ranges
++++ Advanced ACL (3000 to 3999)
Source and Destination IPv4 addresses, IPv4 protocol types, ICMP types, TCP source/destination port numbers, UDP source/destination port numbers, and effective time ranges
++++ Layer 2 ACL (4000 to 4999)
Ethernet frame headers, Source and Destination MAC addresses, Layer 2 Protocol types
++++ User-defined ACL (5000 to 5999)
Packet headers, offsets, character string masks, user-defined character strings
++++ User ACL (6000 to 6999)
Source IPv4 addresses or user control list (UCL) groups, Destination IPv4 addresses or Destination UCL groups, IPv4 protocol types, ICMP types, TCP source/destination port numbers, and UDP source/destination port numbers
Example:
acl number 2000
	rule 5 deny source 10.1.1.1 0
acl number 3000
	rule 5 permit ip source 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 destination 10.1.3.0 0.0.0.255

-- Based on ACL identification methods
++++ Numbered ACL
++++ Named ACL
