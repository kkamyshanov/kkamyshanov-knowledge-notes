Private IP address mapped to a Public IP address from a NAT address pool 
Dynamically assigned Private IP address to unused Public IP address
If Private disappear, Public IP address gets status "Not Use"

Configuring Dynamic NAT
-- Create an address pool
{} nat address-group <group-index> <start-addres> <end-address>
-- Configure an ACL rule for NAT
{} acl <number>
{acl-basic-number} rule permit source <source-address> <source-wildcard>
-- Configure outbound NAT with the address pool in the interface view
{GE0/0/0} nat outbound <acl-number> address-group <group-index> { no-pat }

Example for Configuring Dynamic NAT
--------------------------- {R1}
{} nat address-group 1 122.1.2.1 122.1.2.3
{} acl 2000
{acl-basic-2000} rule 5 permit source 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
{acl-basic-2000} quit
{} interface GE0/0/1
{GE0/0/1} nat outbound 2000 address-group 1 no-pat
