Dynamic NAT does not translate port numbers (It belongs to No-Port Address Translation (No-PAT))
NAPT Network Address and Port Translation 
192.168.1.1:10321 -> 122.1.2.2:1025

Example for Configuring NAPT
--------------------------- {R1}
{} nat address-group 1 122.1.2.1 122.1.2.2
{} acl 2000
{acl-basic-2000} rule 5 permit source 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
{acl-basic-2000} quit
{} interface GE0/0/1
{GE0/0/1} nat outbound 2000 address-group 1

EasyIP 
Same as NAPT, but difference - does not involve address pools
EasyIP applies to scenarios where public IP addresses are not fixed, such as scenarios where public IP addresses are dynamically obtained by egress devices on private networks through DHCP or PPPoe dialup

Example for Configuring Easy IP
{acl-basic-2000} rule 5 permit source 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
{acl-basic-2000} quit
{} interface GE0/0/1
{GE0/0/1} nat outbound 2000
