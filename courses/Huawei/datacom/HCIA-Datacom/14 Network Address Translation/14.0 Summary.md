In this chapter, Network Address Translation we learn the motivation behind NAT, and implementations and application scenarios of different types of NAT
You should be able to answer the following questions:
-- What is the motivation behind NAT?
-- What is NAT classification and how to implement?
-- When to apply NAT selection in different scenarios?

-- Using private addresses in private networks and using NAT at the network egress effectively reduce the number of required public IPv4 addresses. NAT effectively alleviates the shortage of public IPv4 addresses
-- Dynamic NAT, NAPT, and Easy IP provide source address translation for private network hosts to access the public network
-- NAT Server enables internal servers to provide services for public networks
-- Static NAT provides one-to-one mapping and supports bidirectional communication
