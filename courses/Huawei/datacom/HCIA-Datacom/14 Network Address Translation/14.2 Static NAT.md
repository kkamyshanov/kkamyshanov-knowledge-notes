A private IP address is mapped to a fixed public IP address
One Private mapped to One Public (one-to-one)
Useful to get external access to private recourses 

Configuring Static NAT
-- Set configuration for interface
{GE0/0/1} nat static global <global-address> inside <host-address>
<global-address> - external public IP address
<host-address> - internal private IP address
-- Set configuration for system
{} nat static global <global-address> inside <host-address>
-- Enable NAT on interface
{GE0/0/1} nat static enable

Example for Configuring Static NAT
--------------------------- {R1}
{} interface GE0/0/1
{GE0/0/1} ip address 122.1.2.1 24
{GE0/0/1} nat static global 122.1.2.1 inside 192.168.1.1
{GE0/0/1} nat static global 122.1.2.2 inside 192.168.1.2
{GE0/0/1} nat static global 122.1.2.3 inside 192.168.1.3
