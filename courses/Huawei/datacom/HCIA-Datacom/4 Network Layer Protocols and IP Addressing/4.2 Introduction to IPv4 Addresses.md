4.2.1 Concepts
An IPv4 address is 32 bits long
IP Address Structure
Network part - identifies a network
Host part - identifies a host based on mask
192.168.10.20/24 ->. 192.168.10. - network, .20 - host
Code: (ipV4_Addr_destination ^ ipV4_Addr_host & ipV4_Mask) != 0 -> set GTW mac address

4.2.2 Address Classification
++ Class A 0.0.0.0~127.255.255.255 Assigned to hosts -> MASK /8 [0NNNNNNN]->127
++ Class B 128.0.0.0~191.255.255.255 Assigned to hosts -> MASK /16 [10NNNNNN]->191
++ Class C 192.0.0.0~223.255.255.255 Assigned to hosts -> MASK /24 [110NNNNN]->223
++ Class D 224.0.0.0~239.255.255.255 (Used for multicast) [1110NNNN]->239
++ Class E 240.0.0.0~255.255.255.255 (Used for research) [1111NNNN]->255
IP Address Types (Example 192.168.10.0/24~192.168.10.255/24)
++ Network address -> 192.168.10.0 (cant use for hosts)
++ Broadcast address -> 192.168.10.255 (cant use for hosts)
++ Available addresses -> 192.168.10.1/24~192.168.10.254/24 (2n-2 (254 = 2^8-2) number bits in the host part)
Private IP Addresses
++ Public IP addresses - an IP address is assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), each address uniqoe on the Internet
++ Private IP address - in practice, some networks do not need to connect to the internet (lab or college) (Class A, B, C reserved for preceding situations)
|RFC 1918 name|IP address range|Classful description|
|24-bit block|10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255|single class A network|
|20-bit block|172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255|16 contiguous class B networks|
|16-bit block|192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255|256 contiguous class C networks|
Special IP Addresses
++ Limited broadcast address -> 255.255.255.255 (sent to all hosts)
++ Any IP address -> 0.0.0.0 Address of any network
++ Loopback address -> 127.0.0.0/8 (test system of a device)
++ Link-local address -> 169.254.0.0/24 (if a host fails to automatically obtain an IP address, the host can use an IP address in this address block for temporary communication)
