6.2.1 Establishing an OSPF Adjacency Relationship
Types of relationships:
-- Neighbour Relationship
-- Adjacency (database on the two routers are synchronized)
Start send and listen "Hello" packets
Process of Establishing an OSPF Adjacency Relationship
-- Establish a bidirectional neighbour relationship (between both ends)
-- Negotiate the master/slave status (between both ends)
-- Mutually describe the LSDB (summary information) (between both ends)
-- Update LSAs and synchronize LSDBs of both ends (between both ends)
-- Calculate routes (separately on each device)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Step 1 "We're neighbours"
Typology: R1(1.1.1.1) <-> R2(2.2.2.2)
++ R1->: Hello: I'm 1.1.1.1 I don't know who's on the link
++ <-R2: Hello: I'm 2.2.2.2 I found my neighbour 1.1.1.1
++ R1: added 2.2.2.2 to the neighbour list
++ R1->: Hello: I'm 1.1.1.1 I found my neighbour 2.2.2.2
++ R2: changed status of 2.2.2.2 in the neighbour table
++ R1<->R2: We're neighbours
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Step 2 and 3 "LSDB contains"
Typology: R1(1.1.1.1) <-> R2(2.2.2.2)
++ R1->: Exchange Start: DD (content empty, sequence number is X)
I'm the master and my router ID is 1.1.1.1
++ <-R2: Exchange Start: DD (content empty, sequence number is Y)
I'm the master and my router ID is 2.2.2.2 (because my ID is larger)
++ R1: R2 with a larger router ID is preferred
++ R1->: DD (sequence number Y)
This is the summary of LSAs in my LSDB
++ <-R2: Exchange: DD  (sequence number Y + 1 in ascending order)
This is the summary of LSAs in my LSDB
++ R1->: Exchange: DD  (sequence number Y + 1)
Confirms the DD packet sent by the master router
++ R1<->R2: Exchange: DD packets to describe the summary of their own LSAs
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Step 4 "LSDBs are synchronized" 
Typology: R1(1.1.1.1) <-> R2(2.2.2.2)
++ R1->: Loading: LSR -> request full info about xx LSA
++ <-R2: Loading: LSU -> full info about requested LSA
++ R1->: Loading: LS ACK -> confirm LSU and xx LSA in LSU
++ R1->: Loading: LSR -> request full info about yyy LSA
++ <-R2: Loading:  also request full process
++ R1->R2: LSDBs are synchronized

6.2.2 OSPF Network Types
OSPF Network Types (command: <ospf network type>):
-- NBMA (Non-Broadcast Multiple Access)
multiple network devices to access but does not support broadcast
example: Frame Relay (FR) network
-- BMA (Broadcast) (Broadcast Multiple Access)
example: Ethernet Network
when int uses Ethernet encap -> default network type of the OSPF interface is BMA
-- P2MP (Point-to-Multipoint)
bundling endpoints of multiple P2P links
no link layer protocol is considered as a P2MP network by default 
must be manually changed from another network type
-- P2P (Point-to-Point)
indicates that only two network devices can be connected on a link
example: PPP link
when int uses PPP encap -> default network type of the OSPF interface is P2P

Background of DR and BDR
MA - Multiple Access (network)
Need to reduce LSA Flooding for Bus Topology
for MA we have three types of OSPF routers:
-- DR (Designated Router)
establish adjacencies with other OSPF routers
-- BDR (Backup Designated Router)
establish adjacencies with other OSPF routers
monitors DR status, and will stay DR, if original DR fails BDR -> DR (if origin DR failed)
-- DRother
do not establish OSPF adjacencies with one another

OSPF Domain and Single Area
++ OSPF Domain - network that consists of a series of contiguous OSPF network devices that use the same policy
++ OSPF router floods LSAs in the same area

Multi-Area OSPF
Useful for large-scale networking
Multi-area reduces the flooding scope of LSAs
A0&1D - area 0 and 1 device
A0D<->A0&1D<->A2D

Types of OSPF Routers
-- Internal router
-- Area border router (ABR)
-- Backbone router
-- AS boundary router (ASBR)
