6.1.1 Classification of Dynamic Routing Protocols
Open Shortest Path First
Why we need dynamic Routing Protocol
-- Adapt large-scale networks
-- Dynamically respond to network changes
OSPF -> Interior Gateway Protocol (by ASs one autonomous system)
OSPF -> Link-State Routing Protocols (by working mechanism and algorithms)
-- Distance-Vector Routing Protocol (not OSPF)
++ Periodically floods routes (routing table)
++ Each router knows only about where destination is and how far the destination is, but unclear about the whole network topology
-- Link-State Routing Protocol (OSPF)
++ Neighbour relationship setup
++ LSA Flooding
++++ LSAs, instead of routes, are advertised
++++ LSA describes a router interface's status information, such as the cost of the interface and a connected interface name
++ LSDB Creation (Link State Database)
++++ Router stores LSAs in the LSDB
++++ LSDB contains the description of all router interfaces on the network
++++ LSDB contains the description of the entire network topology
++ SPF Calculation (SPF algorithm)
++++ Each router calculates a loop-free tree with itself as the root over the shortest path
++ Routing Table Generation (RIB: Routing Information Base)
++++ Based on SPF calculation results. each router installs routes into routing table

6.1.2 Introduction to OSPF
OSPFv2 -> RFC 2328 -> IPv4
OSPFv3 -> RFC 2740 -> IPv6
-- OSPF Area (considered as a logical group)
each group identified by an area ID
-- OSPF Router ID (unique ID for routers (an OSPF area))
-- OSPF Cost Value (int_def/int_bandwidth)
each int has specific coast
we accumulate costs when packet goes through the router
-- OSPF Packet Types
---- Hello (to discover and maintain OSPF neighbour relationships)
---- Database Description (DD) (describes summary of local LSDB, sync LSDBs of two devices)
---- Link State Request (request a needed LSA from a neighbour, send only after DD exchanged)
---- Link State Update (advertise requested LSA)
---- Link State ACK (acknowledged of LSA)
-- Type of Tables
---- OSPF Neighbour table
display ospf peer
---- LSDB table
display ospf lsdb
---- OSPF routing table
display ospf routing
