OSI Reference Model
7 Application - provides interfaces for applications
6 Presentation Layer - translates data formats to ensure that the application-layer data of one system can be identified by the application layer of another system
5 Session Layer - establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between communicating parties
4 Transport Layer - establishes, maintains, and cancels an end-to-end data transmission process, controls transmission speeds and adjusts data sequences
3 Network Layer - defines logical addresses and transfers data from sources to destinations
2 Data Link Layer - encapsulates packets into frames, transmits frames in P2P or P2MP mode, and implements error checking
1 Physical Layer - transmits bitstreams over transmission media and defines electrical and physical specifications

TCP/IP Reference Model (Standart) (OSI eqv)
4 Application Layer (7,6,5 Application Layer)
3 Host-to-Host Layer (4 Transport Layer)
2 Internet Layer (3 Network Layer)
1 Network Access Layer (2,1 Data Link Layer, Physical Layer)

Common TCP/IP Protocols
++ Application (Telnet(23), FTP(20,21), TFTP(69), SNMP, HTTP(80), SMTP(25), DNS, DHCP)
Data Message (Data) (Application) encapsulated into PDU packet
++ Transport Layer (TCP, UDP)
PDUs transmitted at the transport layer are called segments
TCP (IETF in RFC 793)
UDP (IETF in RFC 768)
++ Network Layer (ICMP, IGMP, IP)
PDUs transmitted at the network layer are called packets
++ Data Link Layer (PPPoE, Ethernet, PPP, ARP)
PDUs transmitted at the data link layer are called frames
ARP Address Resolution Protocol
++ Physical Layer (---)
PDUs transmitted at the physical layer are called bitstreams

Common Protocol Standardization Organizations
++ IETF Internet Engineering Task Force
Voluntary organization responsible for developing and promoting internet protocols, and releasing new or replacing old protocol standards through RFCs
++ IEEE Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineer
Formulated 30% of standards in the electronics, electrical and computer science fields worldwide (Example: IEEE802.3(Ethernet), IEEE802.11(Wi-Fi))
++ ISO International Organization 
Computer network standards (Example: OSI model (ISO/IEC 7498-1))

Common Application Layer Protocols
++ FTP File Transfer Protocol (Client-Server model)
++ Telnet Remote Login Service (Client-Server model)
++ HTTP HyperText Transfer Protocol

TCP and UDP - Port Numbers
Different Applications use different port numbers

TCP Sequence - byte position of sended data
TCP Ack - byte position of accepted data

TCP Window Sliding Mechanism - data transmission rate (Window (16)) field
Number of bytes that you can send now (Example win = 512, we can send one packet with 512 bytes, or two packets with 256B + 256B)

Working Process of a Network Layer Protocol
Important function - Routing table
Network A -> G0/0/1 (Send to this interface) 

ARP Implementation Principles
FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF - broadcast mac address
00-00-00-00-00-00 - unknown mac address

Common Transmission Media
++ Data transmission through twisted pairs
++ Data transmission through optical fibers
++ Data transmission through serial cables
++ Data transmission through wireless signals
