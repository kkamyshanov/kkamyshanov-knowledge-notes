Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (AAA)
Management mechanism for network
Steps
-- 1 User identity (account and password)
-- 2 Authentication (access resources)
-- 3 Authorization (access is granted authorization)
-- 4 Accounting (check access information)

Includes
-- User
-- Network Access Server (NAS)
-- AAA Server (has info about user + pass)

Authentication Modes
-- Non-Authentication
-- Local Authentication (done by NAS (login + pass))
-- Remote Authentication (NAS will send to AAA server (login + pass))

Authorization Modes
Includes: User Group, VLAN ID, ACL number
-- Non-Authorization (None)
-- Local Authorization (Internet access is allowed) 
-- Remote Authorization (Authorization is granted by a remote server) (Get permissions from AAA server after Authentication)

AAA Server Types
-- RADIUS (UDP, 1812)
-- HWTACACS

Accounting Modes
-- Non-Accounting
-- Remote Accounting (process with AAA server) (Accounting-Start request/response)

AAA Implementation Protocol - RADIUS
User <-> NAS <-> RADIUS Server (RDS)
User -> NAS | username + pass
NAS -> RDS | Access-Request
NAS <- RDS | accepted or rejected, corresponding packet is delivered
User <- NAS | Get Authentication result
NAS -> RDS | Accounting-Start request
NAS <- RDS | Accounting-Start response
User <-> RDS | The user starts to access network resources
User -> NAS | The user requests to go offline
NAS -> RDS | Accounting-Stop request
NAS <- RDS | Accounting-Stop response
User <- NAS | notified of completion of network access

Common AAA Application Scenarios
-- AAA for Internet Access Users Through RADIUS
++++ AAA schemes are configured on the NAS to implement interworking between the NAS and RADIUS server
++++ After the user enters a username and a passwordon the client, the NAS sends the username and password to the RADIUS server for authentication
++++ If the authentication succeeds, the user is granted the Internet access permission
++++ The RADIUS server can record the user's network resourse utilization during Internet access
-- Local Authentication and Authorization for Administrative Users
++++ After local AAA schemes are configured on Router, Router compares the username and password of the network administrator with the locally configured username and password when the network administrator logs in to Router
++++ After the authentication succeeds, Router grants certain administrator permissions to the network administrator
