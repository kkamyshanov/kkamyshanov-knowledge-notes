VLAN technology separate a network into several broadcast domains, preventing users in different VLANs from communicating with each other
However, such users sometimes need to communicate. This chapter describes how to implement inter-VLAN communication
You should be able to answer the following questions:
-- How to use routers (physical interfaces or sub-interfaces) to implement inter-VLAN communication?
-- How to use Layer 3 switches to implement inter-VLAN communication?
-- How Layer 3 packets are forwarded?

-- Describes three methods of implementing inter-VLAN communication: through physical interfaces, sub-interfaces, and VLANIF interfaces
-- Elaborates the Layer 3 communication process, and device processing mechanism and packet header changes during the communication
