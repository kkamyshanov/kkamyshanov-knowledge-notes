-- Different IP address segments are assigned to different VLANs
-- Communication between same VLANs (Layer 2 communication)
-- Inter-VLAN communication belongs to Layer 3 communication, which requires Layer 3 devices
-- Inter-VLAN communication is implemented by connecting a Layer 2 switch to a Layer 3 interface of a Layer 3 device. The communication packets are routed by the layer 3 device
