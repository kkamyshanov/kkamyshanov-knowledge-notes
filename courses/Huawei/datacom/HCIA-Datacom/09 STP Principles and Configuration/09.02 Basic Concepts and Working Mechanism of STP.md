9.2.1 STP Basic Concepts
BID - bridge ID (Bridge is a switch)
-- As defined in IEEE 802.1D, a BID consists of 16-bit bridge priority and a bridge MAC address
-- Each switch running STP has a unique BID
-- Bridge priority occupies the leftmost 16 bits and the MAC address occupies the rightmost 48 bits
-- On an STP network, the device with the smallest BID acts as the root bridge
4096-4c1f-aabc-102c
4096 - bridge priority
4c1f-aabc-102c - bridge MAC address
Root bridge (root of an STP network)
-- STP calculates a loop-free STP tree
-- STP elects a root bridge  -> it is key for topology calculation of spanning tree
-- STP calculates loop-free topology based on root bridge
-- Device with the smallest BID (high priority) acts as the root bridge (if the same, choose device with a smallest MAC)

RPC Root Path Cost - from a port to the root bridge is the sum of costs of all inbound ports along the path from the root bridge to the device
PID Port ID - port priority(4b) and port number(12b)
BPDU Bridge Protocol Data Unit
-- Configuration BPDU (key to STP topology calculation)
-- Topology Change Notification (TCN) BPDU (triggered only when the network topology changes)

Cost
-- Each STP-enabled port maintains a cost
-- Cost used to calculate the RPC
-- Default cost of a port is related to the rate, working mode and STP cost calculation method used by a switch
-- Higher port bandwidth indicates a smaller cost
-- Can adjust the cost of a port (with command)

Methods
-- IEEE 802.1d-1998
-- IEEE 802.1t

Format of Configuration BPDUs {bytes}
-- {2} PID - for STP, always 0
-- {1} PVI - for STP, always 0
-- {1} BPDU Type - 0x00 (Configuration BPDU), 0x80 (TCN BPDU)
-- {1} Flags - Topology Change Acknowledge (TCA) and Topology Change (TC)
-- {8} Root ID - BID of the root bridge (use for calculate best port and best path cost)
-- {4} RPC - STP cost of patch from the current port to the root bridge (use for calculate best port and best path cost)
-- {8} Bridge ID - BID of the sender (use for calculate best port and best path cost)
-- {2} Port ID - ID of port that sends this BPDU (port priority and port number) (use for calculate best port and best path cost)
-- {2} Message Age - Number of seconds after a BPDU is sent from the root bridge (increase by 1 each time the BPDU passes through a network bridge (refers to the number of hops to the root bridge)) 
-- {2} Max Age - If the bridge does not receive any BPDU for a period of time an the lifetime of the network bridge reaches the maximum, the network bridge considers that the link connected to the port is faulty  (default 20s)
-- {2} Hello Time - Interval at which the root bridge sends configuration BPDUs (default 2s)
-- {2} Forward Delay - Time that is spent in Listening or Learning state (default 15s)

STP selects the optimal configuration BPDU in the following sequence
-- Smallest BID of root bridge
-- Smallest RPC
-- Smallest BID of network bridge
-- Smallest PID


9.2.2 STP Calculation
Select Root Bridge
-- Sends configuration BPDUs (contains BID of a switch)
-- Smallest BID becomes root bridge
-- Only one root bridge exists on a contiguous STP switching network
-- Role of the root bridge can be preempted
Select Root Port (on Each Non-root Bridge)
-- Each non-root bridge selects a root port
-- Each non-root bridge has only one root port
-- Root is shortest distance away from the root bridge
Select Designated Port (elected on each link)
-- If the former is better, the port is a designated port
-- If the latter is better, the port is not a designated port
-- In most cases, all ports on the root bridge are designated ports

STP Port States
-- Disabled (port cannot send or receive BPDUs or service data frames)
-- Blocking (blocked by STP, cannot send but can listen BPDUs, can't send and recieve service data or learn MAC address)
-- Listening (STP calculation process, can send and receive BPDUs, but can't rsend and recieve service data or learn MAC address )
-- Learning (listen service data, but can't forward them, after receiving service data, port learns MAC address)
-- Forwarding (can send and receive service data, and process BPDUs, only root, or designated can enter to Forwarding mode)
STP Port State Transition
(1) - When a port is initialized or activated, it automatically enters the blocking state
(2) - The port is elected as the root port or designated port and automatically enters the Listening state
(3) - The Forward Delay timer expires and the port is still the root port of designated port
(4) The port is no longer the root port or designated port
(5) The port is disabled or the link fails
-- Disabled or Down
(1) -> Blocking
-- Blocking
(2) -> Listening
(5) -> Disabled or Down
-- Listening
(3) -> Learning
(4) -> Blocking
(5) -> Disabled or Down
-- Learning
(3) -> Forwarding
(4) -> Blocking
(5) -> Disabled or Down
-- Forwarding
(4) -> Blocking
(5) -> Disabled or Down


9.2.3 Topology Change
----------------------Root Bridge Fault Rectification Process
(1)-->SW1<->SW2<->SW3<--(1)
-- SW1 stops send BPDUs
-- SW2 waits (MaxAge 20s) -> SW2 learns the upstream device fails
-- Non-root bridges send config BPDUs to each other to elect a new root bridge
-- After re-election, port A of SW3 transitions to the Forwarding state after two intervals of the Forward Delay timer (default 15s)
++++ Non-root bridge starts root bridge re-election after BPDUs age
++++ Due to the root bridge failure, it takes about 50s to recover from a root bridge failure
----------------------Direct Link Fault Rectification Process
On a stable network, when SW2 detects that the link of the root port is faulty, the alternate port of SW2 enters the Forwarding state after twice the value of the Forward Delay timer (default 15s)
-- After SW2 detects a fault on the direct link , it switches the alternate port to the root port
-- If a direct link fails, the alternate port restores to the Forwarding sate after 30s
----------------------Interact Link Fault
When the indirect link fails, the alternate port on SW3 restores to the Forwarding state. It takes about 50s to recover from an indirect link failure
----------------------The MAC Address Table is Incorrect Because the Topology Changes
-- TCN BPDUs are generated when the network topology changes
-- Packet format: protocol identifier, version number, and type
-- Topology change: The TCA and TC bits in the Flags field of configuration BPDUs are used
