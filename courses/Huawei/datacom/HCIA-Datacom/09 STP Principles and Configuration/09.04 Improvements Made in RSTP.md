Disadvantages of STP
-- Loop-free network but is slow to converge (50s)
-- Difficulty protocol
-- STP algorithm does not determine topology changes until the timer expires, delaying network convergence 
-- STP algorithm requires the root bridge to send configuration BPDUs after the network topology becomes stable, and other devices process and spread the configuration BPDUs through the entire network. This also delays convergence

RSTP Rapid STP
-- Defined in IEEE 802.1w is an enhancement to STP, RSTP optimizes STP in many aspects, provides faster convergence, and is compatible with STP
-- Introduces new port roles. When the root port fails, the switch can enable the alternate port to obtain an alternate path from the designated bridge to the bridge. RSTP defines three states for a port based on whether the port forwards user traffic and learns MAC addresses. In addition, RSTP introduces the edge port that enters the Forwarding state immediately after initialization, thus improving the working efficiency

Port Roles in RSTP
-- RSTP adds port roles to help understand RSTP and simplify RSTP deployment
++++ Root port, designated port, alternate port, backup port
++++ If root port will failed, switch will immediately change to alternate port
++++ If designated port will failed, switch will immediately change to backup port

Edge Port
-- An edge port is located at the edge of a region and does not connect to any switching device
-- Generally, an edge port is directly connected to a user terminal
-- The edge port can transition from the Disabled state to the Forwarding state

Port States in RSTP
-- RSTP deletes two port states defined in STP, reducing the number of port states to three
STP Port State - RSTP Port State - Port Role
Forwarding - Forwarding - Root or designated port
Learning - Learning - Root or designated port
Listening - Discarding - Root or designated port
Blocking - Discarding - Alternate port or backup port
Disabled - Discarding - Disabled port
