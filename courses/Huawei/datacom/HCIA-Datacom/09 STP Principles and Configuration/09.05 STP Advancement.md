Defects of STP/RSTP
-- All VLANs Share One Spanning Tree
-- Cannot make load balancing (but we can use VBST)

VBST VLAN Broadcasting Spanning Tree
-- We can create different tree for different VLANs

MSTP Multicast STP
-- MSTP maps VLANs to an MSTI (multiple spanning tree instance). Multiple VLANs can share one spanning tree
++++ Even-numbered VLANs are mapped to MSTI 1
++++ Odd-numbered VLANs are mapped to MSTI 2
-- Only two spanning trees are maintained on the network

Stack and Tree Networking (STP -> iStack)
-- Traditional STP Networking
STP blocks ports on the network, causing a failure to fully utilize link bandwidth
-- iStack Networking (Aggregation switches)
Aggregation switches are stacked to form a single logical device, simplifying the network topology. In a addition, link aggregation is deployed between aggregation switches and access switches to simplify the network topology to a tree topology, eliminating Layer 2 loops and improving link bandwidth utilization

Smart Link
-- Tailored for dual-uplink networking
-- Deployed on two switches where a host is dual-homed. When the network is normal, one of the two uplinks is active, and the other is in standby state (does not carry/service traffic) -> Layer 2 loop is eliminated
-- When active link is faulty, traffic is switched to the standby link in milliseconds. This ensures proper data forwarding
-- Easy to configure
-- Does not involve protocol packet exchange, therefore greatly improving speed and reliability
